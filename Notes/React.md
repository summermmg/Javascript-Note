## Lifecycle

## Hooks
>Hooks are functions that let you ‚Äúhook into‚Äù React state and lifecycle features from function components. 
### State Hook
We call `useState` inside a function component to add some local state to it. 

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
#### Functional updates
If the new state is computed using the previous state, you can pass a function to `setState`. The function will receive the previous value, and return an updated value. Here‚Äôs an example of a counter component that uses both forms of `setState`:
```
function Counter({initialCount}) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(initialCount)}>Reset</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}
```
### Effect Hook
You‚Äôve likely performed data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components before. We call these operations ‚Äúside effects‚Äù because they can affect other components and can‚Äôt be done during rendering. **Put 'side effect' operations in useEffect hook.** 
>By default, React runs the effects after every render ‚Äî including the first render. but you can choose to fire them only when certain values have changed.

React guarantees the DOM has been updated by the time it runs the effects.

#### Effects Without Cleanup
Sometimes, we want to **run some additional code after React has updated the DOM**. Network requests, manual DOM mutations, and logging are common examples of effects that don‚Äôt require a cleanup. We say that because we can run them and immediately forget about them. 
#### Effects With Cleanup
For example, we might want to set up a subscription to some external data source. In that case, it is important to clean up so that we don‚Äôt introduce a memory leak!
#### What can I do if my effect dependencies change too often?
Sometimes, your effect may be using state that changes too often. You might be tempted to omit that state from a list of dependencies, but that usually leads to bugs:
```
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(count + 1); // This effect depends on the `count` state
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []); // üî¥ Bug: `count` is not specified as a dependency

  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
}
```
The empty set of dependencies, `[]`, means that the effect will only run once when the component mounts, and not on every re-render. The problem is that inside the `setInterval` callback, the value of `count` does not change, because we‚Äôve created a closure with the value of `count` set to `0` as it was when the effect callback ran. Every second, this callback then calls `setCount(0 + 1)`, so the count never goes above 1.

Specifying `[count]` as a list of dependencies would fix the bug, but would cause the interval to be reset on every change. To fix this, we can use the functional update form of `setState`. It lets us specify how the state needs to change without referencing the current state:
```
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1); // ‚úÖ This doesn't depend on `count` variable outside
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []); // ‚úÖ Our effect doesn't use any variables in the component scope

  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
}
```
### Additional Hooks 
#### useReducer (same as reducer concept in Redux)
```
const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
```
`useReducer` is usually preferable to `useState` when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. 
```
const initialState = {count: 0};

function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'decrement'})}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'increment'})}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}
```
